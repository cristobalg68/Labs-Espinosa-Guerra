Con respecto a la importancia del EDA en la comprensión alcanzada sobre los datos, este fue muy relevante ya que en esta etapa se descubrieron los tipos de columnas con las que contaba el dataset, sus distribuciones (para poder realizar escalamiento más adelante), existencia de datos nulos y outliers (para luego realizar filtros), etc.\n","\n","En relación a la clasificación, el rendimiento de los modelos del baseline fue mediocre dada su simpleza pero sirvió para definir qué modelos continuar optimizando para generar la predicción. De los modelos entrenados en el baseline se escogieron RandomForestClassifier y LightGBMClassifier para optimizar y se llegó a la conclusión de que el mejor pipeline correspondía a un selector de caracteristicas del tipo percentil, escogiendo el percentil 40 y un RandomForestClassifier de las siguientes características:\n","\n","* criterion = ‘entropy’\n","* max_depth = 5\n","* n_estimators = 150\n","\n","Si bien con este modelo los resultados de la clasificación mejoraron con respecto al baseline en las métricas de precisión y recall para la clase “Risky”, la mejora fue leve y el rendimiento es considerado solo aceptable.\n","\n","No estamos conformes de los resultados obtenidos, ya que estos son solo un poco mejores que el caso aleatorio y por tanto pueden no ser tan utiles en la practica como para tomar decisiones a partir de ellos. Por ello se plantea modelar el problema con series de tiempo, utilizando registros hitoricos de los clientes y no solamente la última instancia o el promedio de ellas. \n","\n","Con respecto a los aprendizajes, se reafirmaron los conocimientos adquiridos durante los laboratorios, revisando desde la exploración de datos, el preprocesamiento de datos, la creación de características, la creación y entrenamiento de pipelines, la optimización de modelos a través de grillas de búsqueda y la intepretabilidad de resultados. Algunos de los conocimientos que nos habría gustado revisar en este curso habrían sido redes neuronales, ya que es un tema recurrente en el área y no visto en esta asignatura."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":["rAV6bC6lbeJw","-s3OvKLqbeJy","hfzgoc3MbeJ4","UPrACBArbeJ4","WiIT_bh5beJ7","Tw_7pPFAbeJ8","lbMXdivMbeJ9"],"provenance":[]},"deepnote":{},"deepnote_execution_queue":[],"deepnote_notebook_id":"4a4ad4306407402db0c258f95d5a9abe","kernelspec":{"display_name":"env","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.3"},"orig_nbformat":4,"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"f57acf7da6baad4822da805e38ae4df36e3d55cde8439a3ddca6e743ab2b171a"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
